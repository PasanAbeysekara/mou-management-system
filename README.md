# MOU Management System

## Overview
The MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the submission, approval, and tracking of MOUs within an organization. It provides role-based access control for users, domain admins, and super admins to manage the workflow effectively.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with NextAuth.js.
- **MOU Submission**: Users can submit MOUs with required details and documents.
- **Approval Workflow**: Domain admins can approve/reject MOUs related to their domain.
- **Super Admin Panel**: View and manage all MOUs and registered organizations.
- **Search & Filter**: Admins can search MOUs by title and filter them based on status.
- **Email Notifications**: Users receive email notifications upon approval at each stage.
- **Location Mapping**: Super admins can view registered organizations on a map and filter MOUs by location.
- **Real-time Updates**: MOUs nearing expiry (within 3 months) trigger automated notifications.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MUI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM, MySQL Database
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with credential-based login
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage (for document uploads)
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer (for approval notifications)
- **Google Maps API**: Location selection for organizations
